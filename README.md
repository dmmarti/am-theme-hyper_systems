# am-theme-hyper_systems

OVERVIEW

This ZIP package contains an Attract Mode theme to be used within Attract Mode on a Raspberry Pi or PC.

This theme is based on Dwayne Hurst's Emulation Station themes.

There are well over 175 Emulation Station themes but only 20 are represented within this theme.

You can always visit his Github page and download any of his HyperXXX themes and use the overlay.png file in this theme.

www.github.com/RetroHursty69

Search on his Github for the keyword "hyper".  Then drill down in the following folder.

_inc\images

You will see a file named:  overlay.png

Download that file and placed it into the Attract Mode themes folder named: backgrounds

If you don't know how to edit the layout.nut file to add the new choice, just rename the new overlay.png file to one of the existing PNG files.  Then it'll show up in Attract Mode as the new image.
